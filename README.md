## 🌍 About Me

Hey there! I'm Rokas, a **data science enthusiast** with a strong foundation in **computer science**. I enjoy diving into data to uncover patterns and building machine learning models that deliver clear, actionable insights.

During my **Bachelor’s in Computer Science**, I delved into languages like Java, C#, SQL, C++, and Python, even creating a video game from scratch using Unity. While that experience was rewarding, I eventually found my passion in **data science and machine learning**, where I felt I could make a deeper impact by solving real-world challenges.

Since making that transition, I’ve worked on a variety of projects, from predictive modeling to risk analysis, focusing on **real-world applications** that drive both personal and professional growth. I enjoy working on projects involving **healthcare, sustainability, sports analytics**, and scenarios that push the boundaries of problem-solving. My goal is to create solutions that not only simplify complex data but also contribute to positive change in the world.
